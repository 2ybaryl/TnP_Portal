Training and Placement management is supported by paper-based systems, databases, spreadsheets and email communications. Training and Placement is an important part of educational institutions where, up until now, most of the work has been done manually. The purpose of this project is the automation of such acitivites conducted by Institutes, specificially our Institute - JUET (Jaypee Institute of Technology, Guna). This project involves minimal manual effort and maximum optimization, abstraction, and security. This is a web application that helps both students and administrators to carry out all activities for this department. This system can be used as an application for the Training and placement officers (TPO) of the college to manage the student information with regard to placement.
